# GAN - Waveform Generator

This repo includes scripts for training Wasserstein GAN's on seismic data. 
The overarching work is in association with Caltech's Seismological Laboratory. 

## Data
The data being used includes 260764 waveforms measured in southern California and Japan. These have been provided by Caltech's Seismology Group and, unfortunately, cannot be shared. Much of the code is adapted to this data set, but may provide a useful example for other GAN implementations.
